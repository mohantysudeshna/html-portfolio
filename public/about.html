<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Sudeshna Mohanty, and I'm currently on an exciting journey pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at ITER, SOA University. 
  My academic endeavors have led me to explore the fascinating world of web development. I've been honing my skills and now have a decent grasp of Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). 
  Coding and creating web applications have become my passion, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this dynamic field.</p>
  <p>Beyond the realm of computers and code, I have a few other passions that keep me inspired and motivated. Singing is one of my greatest joys â€“ there's something truly magical about expressing emotions through music. Whether it's a classic hit or a modern tune, I love to immerse myself in different genres and let my voice carry the melody.</p>
  <p>Movies are another huge part of my life. I'm a big cinephile and enjoy diving into different cinematic worlds. From thrilling blockbusters to heartwarming indie films, I appreciate the art of storytelling in all its forms. My love for movies often finds me exploring new releases, revisiting old favorites, and even dabbling in some film analysis.</p>
  <p>I completed my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya No.1 in Bhubaneswar, where I developed a strong foundation in academics and nurtured my curiosity for learning new things. This curiosity continues to drive me as I embrace new challenges and opportunities, both in my studies and personal life.</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by my corner of the web! I'm excited to share my journey, interests, and experiences with you. Feel free to connect with me as I continue to explore, learn, and grow in this ever-evolving digital world.</p>
